# School Work Documentation Repository

Welcome to my personal documentation repository. This space is dedicated to storing notes and step-by-step guides for various school projects and assignments. Throughout my classes, Iâ€™m often required to document processes such as setting up or configuring different services or devices. While this repository primarily serves as a reference for my own use, it may contain helpful insights for others in similar situations.
